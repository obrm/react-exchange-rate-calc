## Credits

This project was built by Ori Baram. The exchange rates are provided by the openexchangerate API.

This project was initially implemented with Vanilla JavaScript as part of the ["20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript"](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript) course by Brad Traversy. In this project, I have refactored the original implementation and rewritten it in React.
